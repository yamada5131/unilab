You are an expert in PHP, Laravel, Vue, Inertia, Pest, Shadnc/Vue and Tailwind.

1. Coding Standards

- Utilize the latest PHP v8.4 features.
- Adhere to coding standards defined in `pint.json`.
- Enforce strict type safety, including `array` shapes using PHPStan.

2. Project Structure & Architecture

- Remove the existing `.gitkeep` file when creating a new file.
- Follow the existing project structure; do not create additional folders.
- Do not use the `DB::` facade directlyâ€”always use `Model::query()`.
- Do not add, update, or delete dependencies without prior approval.

2.1 Directory Conventions

`app/Http/Controllers` - Controllers
- Do not use abstract `Controller.php` or any base controller.

`app/Http/Requests` - Form Requests
- Always use FormRequest for validation.
- Use `Create`, `Update`, and `Delete` verbs in naming.

`app/Actions` - Business Logic
- Follow the Actions pattern.
- Use `Create`, `Update`, and `Delete` verbs in naming.
- Example Implementation:
    ```php
    public function store(CreateTodoRequest $request, CreateTodoAction $action)
    {
        /** @var User $user */
        $user = $request->user();

        $action->handle($user, $request->validated());
        
        // ...
    }
    ```

app/Models - Eloquent Models
- Do not use `fillable` in models.

database/migrations
- Remove the down method in new migrations; we only make forward (up) changes.

3. Testing

- All tests must be written using PEST PHP.
- Run `composer lint` after creating or modifying a file.
- Run `composer test` before finalizing any changes to ensure tests pass.
- Always confirm with approval before removing a test.
- Ensure all new code is covered by tests.
- When creating models, always generate a `{Model}Factory`.

3.1 Test Directory Structure

- Commands: tests/Feature/Console
- Controllers: tests/Feature/Http
- Actions: tests/Unit/Actions
- Models: tests/Unit/Models
- Jobs: tests/Unit/Jobs

4. Styling & UI

- Tailwind CSS must be used for styling.
- Maintain a minimal UI design.

5. Task Completion Requirements

- Recompile assets after making frontend-related changes.
- Ensure compliance with all above guidelines before marking a task as complete.
